Longs shots below:

- Use different character set for a part (e.g., Content-Type: text/plain;charset=...)

- Use Content-Transfer-Encoding for parts. Candidates:
  - 7bit, 8bit, binary (all 3 identity)
  - quoted-printable
  - base64

- Field names can be encoded using RFC 2047, but are there any implementations
  that support this feature? Yes! Tomcat supports this now:

  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FILEUPLOAD-199

- The spec allows submission of multiple files using multipart/mixed, but I
  am not aware of anyone implementing this feature.
