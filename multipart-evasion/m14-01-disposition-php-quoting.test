# Send a specially-crafted Content-Disposition value to exploit
# the unusual parsing implementation in PHP.
#
# ModSecurity 2.6.5 and earlier incorrectly parse the request, mistaking the
# payload part for a file. PHP sees it as variable "name".
#
# At the time this evasion was tested, ModSecurity Core Rules (CRS) had a
# broad evasion detection rule that catches this attack, but only if configured
# in blocking mode.
